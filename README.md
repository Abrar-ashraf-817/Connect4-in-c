# Connect4-in-c
basic connect4 game written in c.
My first attempt at a complete structured programming project.
The code is messy and inefficient, but it was written to showcase what i have learned in the course.
Hence the whacky File useage,recursive main function,etc.
I'll work to improve it as i learn new concepts and technologies.
Untill then enjoy my spagetti code.
